-- Fix RLS policies for user_profiles to allow users to read their own profile
-- Run this if you're getting 406 errors when trying to load user profiles

-- Drop existing policies if they exist (optional - will error if they don't exist, but that's okay)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON user_profiles;

-- Recreate policies with proper permissions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Also ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the policies
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles';
